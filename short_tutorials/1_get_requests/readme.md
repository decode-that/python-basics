### Additional Information
Before running the script do the following: <br>

Step 1: make sure you obtain your own API key from NASA's website: https://api.nasa.gov/ <br>
Step 2: insert the key that you received in .env file <br>
Step 3: run the script <br>

Note that the API key is personal and shouldn't be shared.

If you're missing some python libraries you can always obtain them via pip3, for instance:
`pip3 install python-dotenv`

 Enjoy :-)
